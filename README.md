"Open your shop." We said. "Stop having it be closed."

## What is this fork??

This fork is meant to finish, or at least polish off, this early version of OSC. I don't know PHP and have a limited knowledge of Javascript, and cannot test as of now, so it will mainly be obvious changes. See the commit history on github.com/thetechrobo/ShopChannel for more details.

## What?

The Open Shop Channel is an alternative to The Wii Shop Channel and Homebrew Downloaders for the Nintendo Wii.

## Why?

With the Wii Shop Channel's closure in 2019 and Homebrew Repo services becoming outdated, The Open Shop Channel's purpose is to give both Homebrew Developers and Users a more comfortable experience for downloading and installing homebrew.

## Contributions

Please test changes before pulling, and add screenshots to issues and pull requests.

## How?

We still need to figure out which delivery method is best. So far we have a WAD Patcher and/or private distribution of OSC WAD, but we want to make sure our service is both easily and legally available.

## Who?

We are a group of homebrew enthusiasts that want to provide the easiest way to get homebrew in the safest way possible.
